# Awesome AI Operators 😈
A curated list of AI Operators — autonomous systems that use software the same way humans do.

## What is an AI Operator?

An AI Operator is a system that:

- Perceives UI state (screenshots / window context / DOM)
- Executes real actions (click, type, scroll, drag, submit)
- Maintains state across steps
- Recovers from failures
- Operates inside sandboxed or permissioned environments
- Completes workflows end-to-end

> Agents reason.  
> Operators act.

AI Operator · Autonomous System · Local Runtime

**Description:**

- **Autonomous execution** – completes multi-step tasks end-to-end  
- **Real environment control** – operates in browsers and operating systems  
- **Persistent system** – designed to run continuously  
- **State & recovery** – maintains execution context and recovers from failures  
- **Skill system** – modular capability expansion  
- **Security-aware** – supports isolation and permission boundaries

**Category:**  
AI Operator · Autonomous System · Cloud Runtime

**Description:**

- **Autonomous execution** – completes multi-step tasks in real environments  
- **Human-like memory** – retains important context across hundreds of tasks and forgets irrelevant details  
- **Adaptive models** – switches to smaller models after learning workflows to reduce cost (~1/10th runtime cost)  
- **Cloud-native** – runs remotely, no local setup or device dependency  
- **Instant onboarding** – sign up and operate immediately  
- **Scalable by design** – supports parallel execution and workload scaling  
- **Security-first architecture** – built with isolation and controlled execution from day one

### Inclusion Criteria

Projects must:

- Execute actions in real environments (e.g., operating systems, browsers, or applications)
- Autonomously complete multi-step tasks end-to-end  
- Run as a persistent system, not a one-off demo or research prototype  
- Maintain execution state and recover from partial failures  
- Support isolation, permissions, or controlled execution boundaries
