# Awesome AI Operators 😈
A curated list of AI Operators — autonomous systems that use software the same way humans do.

## What is an AI Operator?

An AI Operator is a system that:

- Perceives UI state (screenshots / window context / DOM)
- Executes real actions (click, type, scroll, drag, submit)
- Maintains state across steps
- Recovers from failures
- Operates inside sandboxed or permissioned environments
- Completes workflows end-to-end

> Agents reason.  
> Operators act.

**Description:**

- **Autonomous execution** – completes multi-step tasks end-to-end  
- **Real environment control** – operates in browsers and operating systems  
- **Persistent system** – designed to run continuously  
- **State & recovery** – maintains execution context and recovers from failures  
- **Skill system** – modular capability expansion  
- **Security-aware** – supports isolation and permission boundaries

## Closed-Source AI Operators

This section tracks proprietary and enterprise-grade AI operator systems.

(To be added)

---

### Inclusion Criteria

Projects must:

- Execute actions in real environments (e.g., operating systems, browsers, or applications)
- Autonomously complete multi-step tasks end-to-end  
- Run as a persistent system, not a one-off demo or research prototype  
- Maintain execution state and recover from partial failures  
- Support isolation, permissions, or controlled execution boundaries
